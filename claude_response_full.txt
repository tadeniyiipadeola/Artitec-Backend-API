**Note:** This search has identified 20 major residential communities in and around the Dallas, TX area. The data has been compiled from various real estate websites, HOA websites, builder websites, and community sources. Confidence scores reflect the availability and verifiability of information found online. Some communities may have limited publicly available HOA fee information or builder details, which is reflected in the data provided. Many established neighborhoods (like Lakewood and Preston Hollow) don't have formal community websites as they are traditional neighborhoods rather than master-planned communities. The communities listed represent a mix of established neighborhoods and newer master-planned developments throughout the Dallas metropolitan area.
